## What Argon is?

Argon is a noble gas.
"Argon" comes from Greek "Argon", neuter of "argos" meaning *lazy* , *idle* or *inactive*.
Argon recieved this name because its chemical inactivity.

Argon NX is an immutable payload which is injected to your Nintendo Switch via Fusee Gelee exploit.

## Purpose 

The purpose of Argon NX is to stay immutable, so you can always inject it, without caring about other payloads getting updated.

## How can it be?

When Argon NX is injected it automatically launches the payload.bin resting on your SD Card root. 

In a near future, you will be able to configure it to list your favourite payloads and launch one of them, or automatically launch an specific payload from your SD Card.

All with a beautiful GUI!!!
